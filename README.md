— A fire outbreak is a hazardous act that leads to numerous consequences. Detecting a fire at an early stage and extinguishing it can aid in prevention of various accidents. Till now we rely on human resource. 
This often leads to risking the life of that person. Therefore, fire security becomes an important aspect to save human lives. A fire fighter’s work entails detecting and extinguishing fires. 
The main objective of the project is to detect and extinguish a small flame. The other sub objectives of the project are as follows:
1. To operate the robot automatically 
2. To automatically detect if the water in the tank is low

The entire robot depend upon motor and sensors. The movement of the robot is performed according to the direction of fire sensed by flame sensors. Out of the three flame sensors used if any of the two flame 
sensors output is high then the robot is stopped and water pumping mechanism is activated. A servo motor is used at the nozzle to guide the water properly towards the fire. In this way, the fire will be 
extinguished. The water level is checked during the entire process. Whenever the float switch indicates low value of water in the container, a buzzer alerts the robot operator that he/she needs to refill the container.
